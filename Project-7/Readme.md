# Derek Benson - Project 7
## Comp 86 - 12/8/2015

## Running

Serve this folder via a webserver and access the index.html file to see my
simulation.

## The Simulation

The simulation consists of two planes flying around a mountain. There are also
two clouds in the sky.

## Controls

The inner plane is controlled using the keys 'w' and 's'. The outer plane is
controlled using the keys 'e' and 'd'. 'w' and 'e' speed their respective planes
up and 's' and 'd' slow their respective planes down.

## Technologies Used

The simulation was built using THREE.js. The simulation was implemented in 
CoffeeScript. The built .js file can be found in js/index.js.
